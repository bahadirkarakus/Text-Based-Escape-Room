         BACKGROUND MUSIC SETUP
===================================================

To add background music to the game:

1. Get a WAV audio file (MP3 won't work with SoundPlayer)
   - Example: "Stranger Things Title Sequence"
   - Convert MP3 to WAV using online converter:
     https://online-audio-converter.com/

2. Rename the file to one of these:
   - background.wav (recommended)
   - stranger_things.wav
   - shape_of_my_heart.wav
   - game_music.wav

3. Place the WAV file in this folder (ConsoleApp1/music/)

4. Run the game with: dotnet run

===================================================

NOTES:
- File MUST be .wav format
- Keep file size reasonable (<10MB)
- If no music file found, game runs silently
- Music loops automatically during gameplay
